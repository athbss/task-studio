# Task UI - Application Design Document

## Introduction

Task UI is a web-based visualization and management interface for the Taskmaster CLI task management system. It transforms the command-line experience of Taskmaster into an intuitive, visual interface that provides real-time insights into task organization, progress, and relationships while maintaining the simplicity and power of the underlying CLI tool.

### Application Purpose

- Provide a visual interface for developers using Taskmaster CLI
- Enable quick task overview and navigation without command-line interaction
- Offer real-time updates as tasks change in the filesystem
- Maintain the local-first, developer-centric approach of Taskmaster

### Target Audience

- Individual developers using Taskmaster for project management
- Development teams wanting visual task boards alongside CLI workflows
- Users who prefer visual interfaces but appreciate CLI power and flexibility

### Core Value Proposition

- **Visual Clarity**: See all tasks, dependencies, and progress at a glance
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes in `.taskmaster` files instantly reflect in the UI
- **Zero Configuration**: Works directly with existing Taskmaster projects
- **Local-First**: No cloud dependencies, works entirely on local machine
- **Non-Intrusive**: Complements CLI workflow without replacing it

### Business Context

Task UI serves as a companion tool to Taskmaster CLI, similar to how Prisma Studio complements Prisma CLI. It aims to lower the barrier to entry for visual thinkers while maintaining the power user features that make Taskmaster effective for complex project management.

## User Experience

### User Personas

1. **The CLI Power User**

   - Primarily uses Taskmaster CLI
   - Opens Circle for quick visual overview
   - Values keyboard shortcuts and efficiency
   - Wants minimal disruption to CLI workflow

2. **The Visual Developer**

   - Prefers visual interfaces
   - Uses Circle as primary Taskmaster interface
   - Occasionally drops to CLI for complex operations
   - Values intuitive UI and clear information hierarchy

3. **The Project Manager**
   - Reviews project progress and task distribution
   - Doesn't modify tasks directly
   - Needs high-level overviews and reports
   - Values filtering and visualization features

### Key User Journeys

1. **Morning Task Review**

   - Open Task UI
   - View current tag context tasks
   - Filter by "in-progress" status
   - Identify next task to work on
   - Copy task details to start work

2. **Project Progress Check**

   - Navigate to specific tag/project
   - View task distribution across statuses
   - Check high-priority incomplete tasks
   - Review dependencies and blockers

3. **Task Discovery**
   - Search for specific keyword across all tags
   - Filter results by status or priority
   - Navigate to task details
   - Understand task context and relationships

### Interface Design Principles

- **Clarity First**: Information hierarchy matches task importance
- **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Familiar patterns from popular task tools
- **Responsive Updates**: Real-time feedback for all changes
- **Keyboard Friendly**: Navigation possible without mouse
- **Information Density**: Balance between overview and detail

### Accessibility Considerations

- Semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Color contrast compliance for readability
- Status and priority indicated by more than color alone
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## System Architecture

### High-Level Components

1. **File System Interface**

   - Reads `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`
   - Watches for file changes using filesystem APIs
   - Parses and validates Taskmaster data format
   - Handles file access errors gracefully

2. **Data Transformation Layer**

   - Maps Taskmaster data model to UI components
   - Maintains task relationships and hierarchies
   - Calculates derived data (progress, counts)
   - Manages tag context switching

3. **User Interface Layer**

   - React-based component system
   - Real-time update handling
   - State management for UI interactions
   - Responsive layout system

4. **Local Storage Layer**
   - Persists user preferences
   - Saves filter configurations
   - Maintains view states
   - Caches processed data for performance

### Data Flow

1. Taskmaster CLI writes to `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`
2. File watcher detects changes
3. Parser validates and transforms data
4. UI components receive updated data
5. User sees real-time updates

### Integration Points

- **Taskmaster CLI**: Primary data source and truth
- **File System**: Direct file access for reading
- **Operating System**: File watching capabilities
- **Browser APIs**: Local storage, clipboard access

### Security and Privacy

- **Local-Only Operation**: No data leaves the machine
- **Read-Only by Default**: Prevents accidental modifications
- **File Access Scope**: Limited to .taskmaster directory
- **No Authentication**: Single-user local tool
- **No Telemetry**: Complete privacy preservation

## Business Logic

### Core Business Rules

1. **Tag Isolation**

   - Each tag represents an independent task context
   - Task IDs are unique only within their tag
   - No cross-tag dependencies are displayed
   - Master tag is marked with warnings

2. **Task Status Flow**

   - Valid statuses: pending, in-progress, done, cancelled
   - Status transitions follow Taskmaster rules
   - Visual indicators for status changes

3. **Priority Levels**

   - Urgent > High > Medium > Low > No Priority
   - Visual prominence matches priority
   - Filtering respects priority ordering

4. **Data Integrity**
   - UI never modifies `.taskmaster` files directly
   - All changes must go through Taskmaster CLI
   - Validation matches Taskmaster requirements

### Data Models (Conceptual)

1. **Task**

   - Unique ID within tag context
   - Title and description
   - Status and priority
   - Optional: assignee, labels, due date
   - Subtasks array
   - Dependencies array

2. **Tag (Project)**

   - Name and description
   - Task collection
   - Metadata (counts, progress)
   - Creation date

3. **User Preferences**
   - Selected view type
   - Active filters
   - Collapsed sections
   - Theme preference

### Workflow Management

- Read tasks from filesystem
- Transform for UI display
- Handle user interactions
- Queue write operations for CLI
- Maintain UI consistency

### Validation Rules

- Task data must match Taskmaster schema
- Invalid data shows error state
- Malformed JSON prevents loading
- File permissions handled gracefully

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Write Operations via CLI**

   - Execute Taskmaster commands from UI
   - Safe task modifications
   - Bulk operations support
   - Undo/redo capabilities

2. **Advanced Visualizations**

   - Dependency graphs
   - Timeline/Gantt views
   - Progress charts
   - Team workload distribution

3. **Collaboration Features**

   - Shared task views
   - Comment system
   - Activity feeds
   - Real-time multi-user sync

4. **Enhanced Search**
   - Natural language queries
   - Smart suggestions
   - Search across file contents
   - Advanced query builder

### Scalability Considerations

- Efficient handling of large task lists (1000+ tasks)
- Virtualized scrolling for performance
- Incremental data loading
- Background processing for heavy operations

### Potential Integrations

- Git integration for branch-based workflows
- IDE plugins for seamless development
- CI/CD pipeline visualization
- Time tracking tools
- Calendar applications

### Long-term Vision

Task UI aims to become the definitive visual interface for Taskmaster, eventually supporting:

- Desktop application via Electron/Tauri
- Cloud sync for team collaboration
- Mobile companion apps
- API for third-party integrations
- Plugin system for custom workflows

While maintaining its core principles of being local-first, developer-centric, and complementary to the CLI experience.
